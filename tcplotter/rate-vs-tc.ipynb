    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a document that combines rich text formatting (like that in a word processor or website) with programming language code. The notebook itself is divided into blocks called cells that have a defined cell type, which means a cell can either contain rich text, code, or raw unformatted text (but not a mix). For us, the main concern will be code cells and how to run them, as that will be the way to produce a plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "To run a code cell, simply click on the cell containing code and press one of the following key combinations:\n",

    "- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> or \n",
    "- <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>return</kbd>\n",

    "[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a cloud computing platform that provides the computing used to run a Jupyter notebook free of charge. You are most likely using Binder right now if you have opened this notebook and the code example above works. You don't really need to know much about Binder in order to use it, however, there is one important note about Binder: **Your session will die and your notebook will stop function after about 10 minutes of inactivity**. This means you may lose any progress you have made in the notebook after this time elapses. If you want to keep your session alive, be sure to run at least one code cell every 10 minutes. Once the session dies...\n",
