The notebook itself is divided into blocks called cells that have a defined cell type, which means a cell can either contain rich text, code, or raw unformatted text (but not a mix). For us, the main concern will be code cells and how to run them, as that will be the way to produce a plot.\n",

This means you may lose any progress you have made in the notebook after this time elapses. If you want to keep your session alive, be sure to run at least one code cell every 10 minutes.

    "T<sub>c</sub>plotter version 0.3.0 and later supports plotting of age data from a file on plots like Figures 2 and 3. In order to plot the data you will need to do a few additional steps prior to creating the plots. These steps are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Age data file format\n",
    "\n",
    "T<sub>c</sub>plotter expects the age data file you will use to have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should be a plain text file with commas separating the values in the file\n",
    "2. It should contain 5 columns:\n",
    "    - The age types (AHe or ZHe)\n",
    "        - AFT ages can also be listed but are currently ignored\n",
    "    - The ages in Ma\n",
    "    - The age uncertainties (standard deviation) in Myrs\n",
    "    - The eU concentration in parts per million\n",
    "    - The effective spherical grain radius in micrometers\n",
    "3. The text file should include a header in the first row\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the file format can be found in the file [`sample_data.csv`](sample_data.csv). The contents of that file are also shown below, for convenience.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Age type, Age (Ma), Standard deviation (Ma), eU concentration (ppm), Grain radius (um)\n",
    "AHe, 45.0, 0.5, 40.0, 60.0\n",
    "AFT, 10.0, 1.5, ,\n",

    "ahe, 73.0, 1.0, 120.0, 90.0\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Option 2: Uploading a file with sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "To use your own text file, you can click on the **Upload Files** icon (upward pointing arrow with a line beneath the arrow) at the top of the Jupyter Lab file browser on the left side of the window. You can then select the file you would like to upload.\n",

    "Below you can find an example of how to use the parameters `age_data_file` and `calc_misfit` to read/plot age data and calculate a misfit. Note that if you have uploaded your own age data file, then you should change the name of the file listed in quotes for the `age_data_file` parameter.\n",
