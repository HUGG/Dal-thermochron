    "# Exercise 2 - Modeling thermochronometer ages in 1D\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will gain some experience with using a simple 1D thermal model to predict thermochronometer ages.\n",
    "To calculate temperatures the model uses an analytical solution to the 1D heat conduction equation with advection from Carlslaw and Jaeger (1959).\n",
    "Thermochronometer ages are predicted by recording the temperature history of a particle as it travels from depth to the surface at the velocity your input.\n",
    "This temperature history is combined with Dodson's equation for calculating an effective closure temperature to determine the time at which the sample cools below the closure temperature.\n",
    "We won't go into detail about how the code works, but if you want to look at it you can find it in the [main directory of this repository](thermochron_functions.py)."

    "3. Changing the simulation time `time_total` to another value. For example, `age_predict(time_total=100)` would run the model for 100 million years.\n",
